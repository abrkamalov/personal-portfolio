Hello! My name is Abror and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2016 when I decided to build a website for my school — needless to say, the task turned out to be much more difficult than I thought, but it taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!

Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of working at a huge corporation and a student-led sport & educational agency.
